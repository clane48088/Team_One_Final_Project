# Team_One_Final_Project
## Indroduction 
We aim to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) based on a variety of demographic, medical, and behavioral indicators. By leveraging existing datasets containing features such as age, gender, medical history, cognitive assessments, and other biomarkers, we seek to build a model capable of forecasting the likelihood of AD development. Our goal is to achieve an accuracy threshold of 75%, which will serve as a benchmark for the model's effectiveness in making reliable predictions.
