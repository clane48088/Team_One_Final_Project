## Alzheimer's Research

### Intro

Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia. It impairs your memory, language, reasoning, coordination, and behavior. The causes of Alzheimer's are shrouded in mystery. What we do know is that it’s a malfunction in brain proteins. This damages the neurons and leads to their eventual death leading to decreased mental function. The disease can exist for years before symptoms first appear. The disease normally begins where we manage memory manifesting symptoms as short term memory loss, then long term memory loss, and then spreads to greater loss of function.

### What is Alzheimer's Disease Doing
Alzheimer’s is a buildup of plaque is a buildup of protein fragments called beta-amyloid that affect communication between brain cells. There are also Tau proteins that help carry nutrients for brain cells. Alzheimer’s changes the shape of Tau proteins and creates structures known as tangles. These two breakdowns of brain protein work to disrupt and eventually kill brain cells. This normally first presents itself symptomatically as short term memory loss and thus leads to dementia.

### Risk Factors
Though not much is known about the causes of Alzheimer’s Disease there are a few risk factors that sources from the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and alz.org provide.

 **Old Age**
* 6.9mil people 65+ and older in the U.S. have Alzheimer’s
* 70% of the 6.9mil were over 75
*  ~65% of the 55mil world wide with dementia have Alzheimer’s
*  Woman are also more likely to get Alzheimer’s but this is because they live longer than men on average
  
  **Genetics (family history)**
* Your risk increases if a biological parent or sibling develops the disease
* You’re 3 times as likely if two or more biological parents or siblings have the disease

**Head Injury**
-   Several studies found the risk of getting dementia and alzheimer’s goes up with people who’ve had a TBI (traumatic brain injury)
-   Risk increases with the severity of the injury

  **Down Syndrome**
-   Potentially due to 3 copies of chromosome 21. 
-   Chromosome 21 is the gene that allows for the production of protein that breaks into plaque with Alzheimer’s
-   Symptoms can appear 10-20 years sooner

**Poor lifestyle and environment**
-   Heavy alcohol use    
-   Smoking / secondhand smoke    
-   Poor air quality   
-   Poor sleep quality   
-   High levels of LDL (diet quality)
